A lightweight browser workspace for macOS.

Candoa Browser is an open-source Mac browser workspace for people who live in tabs, move
between projects, and want browsing to stay native, quiet, and
battery-conscious.

## Why Candoa Browser

Most modern browsers ship a whole cross-platform stack. Candoa Browser takes a simpler
Mac-first path: SwiftUI, AppKit where native behavior needs it, and Apple's
WebKit through `WKWebView`.

That means Candoa Browser can focus on the workflow:

- A sidebar-first browser surface
- Spaces for separating work, personal browsing, projects, and research
- Pinned tabs and vertical tabs
- Fast keyboard navigation
- Split view for two pages at once
- Local session restore and history
- Optional iCloud sync for workspace state
- Automatic updates through Sparkle

Candoa Browser is built independently with native Apple technologies and WebKit.

## Status

Development stopped in September 2026 and the repository is archived.

What the last build (v0.38.0) does: Spaces with iCloud sync, vertical and pinned tabs, split view,
a quick search that targets a site directly, an assistant that asks before it
acts, ad and tracker blocking with no extension needed, extensions installed
straight from the Chrome Web Store, a floating mini player that takes a video
with you when you switch tabs, opt-in crash reporting that never carries a page
address, and automatic updates through Sparkle.

Not there yet: an equivalent of Arc's peek window. DRM playback is unverified,
so assume some streaming services may not work until proven otherwise.

Battery efficiency and native macOS behavior were treated as product features
rather than implementation details.

## Download

The last public build is on the
[Releases](https://github.com/aamancio/candoa-browser/releases) page. It is
signed and notarized but will not receive updates.

## Build From Source

Requirements:

- macOS 14 or newer
- Xcode

Open `Candoa.xcodeproj`, select the `Candoa` scheme, then build and run.

From Terminal:

```sh
cd candoa-browser
xcodebuild -project "Candoa.xcodeproj" -scheme "Candoa" -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath build/DerivedData build
open "build/DerivedData/Build/Products/Debug/Candoa.app"
```

## Project Principles

- Keep the app native to macOS.
- Use WebKit, not Chromium, Electron, CEF, or Firefox.
- Preserve familiar browser shortcuts for comparable features.
- Prefer native SwiftUI and AppKit controls over custom lookalikes.
- Keep background tabs cheap so idle browsing stays efficient.
- Avoid copying another browser's visual identity.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Candoa reserves familiar macOS browser shortcuts for comparable features.

- `Cmd+T`: New tab / command surface
- `Cmd+W`: Close current tab
- `Cmd+L`: Focus address/search bar
- `Cmd+Shift+T`: Reopen last closed tab
- `Cmd+D`: Pin or unpin current tab
- `Cmd+Shift+C`: Copy current tab URL
- `Cmd+Shift+Option+C`: Copy current tab URL as Markdown
- `Cmd+S`: Show or hide sidebar
- `Cmd+Shift+S`: Save page as…
- `Cmd+Shift+K`: Clear unpinned tabs
- `Cmd+1`, `Cmd+2`, `Cmd+3`: Go directly to a tab
- `Control+1`, `Control+2`, `Control+3`: Focus a Space
- `Control+Tab`: Toggle between recent tabs
- `Cmd+Option+Up` / `Cmd+Option+Down`: Switch tabs
- `Cmd+Option+Left` / `Cmd+Option+Right`: Switch Spaces
- `Cmd+Left` or `Cmd+[`: Back
- `Cmd+Right` or `Cmd+]`: Forward
- `Cmd+R`: Reload
- `Cmd+F`: Find in page

## For Contributors

The app is organized around a small native browser core:

- `BrowserStore` owns browser state and user actions.
- `WebViewCoordinator` owns reusable `WKWebView` instances.
- `PersistenceService` stores Spaces, tabs, selection, and local history.
- `NavigationService` handles URL and search input.
- `FaviconService` fetches and caches page icons.

The repository is archived and does not take pull requests. Fork it if you
want to continue the work. The project principles above are a description of
how it was built, not a rule for your fork, except for the trademark note
below.

## Releases

Release builds were packaged as a drag-to-Applications DMG and published with
a Sparkle appcast. The publishing workflow has been removed; the last DMG is
attached to the v0.38.0 release.

Because that DMG uses Developer ID distribution, account authentication must
follow the tracked [Sign in with Apple distribution decision](docs/sign-in-with-apple-distribution.md).

Local DMG packaging:

```sh
xcodebuild -project "Candoa.xcodeproj" -scheme "Candoa" -configuration Release -derivedDataPath build/DerivedData build
Scripts/package_dmg.sh \
  build/DerivedData/Build/Products/Release/Candoa.app \
  artifacts/Candoa.dmg
```

## Trademark

The Candoa name, icon, and app identity are not covered by the source-code
license, and the Candoa name is now used for other software by the same
author. Forks and modified builds must use a different name and identity.
