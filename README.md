# Candoa

A lightweight browser workspace for macOS.

Candoa is an open-source Mac browser for people who like Arc-style sidebars,
Spaces, pinned tabs, and keyboard-first navigation, but want the app to stay
native, quiet, and battery-conscious.

## Why Candoa

Most modern browsers ship a whole cross-platform stack. Candoa takes a simpler
Mac-first path: SwiftUI, AppKit where native behavior needs it, and Apple's
WebKit through `WKWebView`.

That means Candoa can focus on the workflow:

- A sidebar-first browser surface
- Spaces for separating work, personal browsing, projects, and research
- Pinned tabs and vertical tabs
- Fast keyboard navigation
- Split view for two pages at once
- Local session restore and history
- Optional iCloud sync for workspace state
- Automatic updates through Sparkle

Candoa is inspired by the workflow ideas in Arc and the open-source spirit of
Zen Browser. It is not a clone of either product's branding, assets, icons, or
exact visual identity.

## Status

Candoa is an early public prototype. The core shell, WebKit tab model, Spaces,
pinned tabs, split view, local persistence, Sparkle updates, and the first sync
hooks are in place.

Expect rough edges. The project is still shaping the daily browsing experience,
with battery efficiency and native macOS behavior treated as product features,
not implementation details.

## Build From Source

Requirements:

- macOS 14 or newer
- Xcode

Open `Candoa.xcodeproj`, select the `Candoa` scheme, then build and run.

From Terminal:

```sh
cd ~/Projects/Candoa/Candoa
xcodebuild -project "Candoa.xcodeproj" -scheme "Candoa" -configuration Debug -derivedDataPath build/DerivedData build
open "build/DerivedData/Build/Products/Debug/Candoa.app"
```

## Project Principles

- Keep the app native to macOS.
- Use WebKit, not Chromium, Electron, CEF, or Firefox.
- Preserve Arc-compatible shortcuts for Arc-like features.
- Prefer native SwiftUI and AppKit controls over custom lookalikes.
- Keep background tabs cheap so idle browsing stays efficient.
- Avoid copying another browser's visual identity.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Candoa reserves Arc's macOS shortcut model for comparable features.

- `Cmd+T`: New tab / command surface
- `Cmd+W`: Close current tab
- `Cmd+L`: Focus address/search bar
- `Cmd+Shift+T`: Reopen last closed tab
- `Cmd+D`: Pin or unpin current tab
- `Cmd+Shift+C`: Copy current tab URL
- `Cmd+Shift+Option+C`: Copy current tab URL as Markdown
- `Cmd+S`: Show or hide sidebar
- `Cmd+Shift+K`: Clear unpinned tabs
- `Cmd+1`, `Cmd+2`, `Cmd+3`: Go directly to a tab
- `Control+1`, `Control+2`, `Control+3`: Focus a Space
- `Control+Tab`: Toggle between recent tabs
- `Cmd+Option+Up` / `Cmd+Option+Down`: Switch tabs
- `Cmd+Option+Left` / `Cmd+Option+Right`: Switch Spaces
- `Cmd+Left` or `Cmd+[`: Back
- `Cmd+Right` or `Cmd+]`: Forward
- `Cmd+R`: Reload
- `Cmd+F`: Find in page

## For Contributors

The app is organized around a small native browser core:

- `BrowserStore` owns browser state and user actions.
- `WebViewCoordinator` owns reusable `WKWebView` instances.
- `PersistenceService` stores Spaces, tabs, selection, and local history.
- `NavigationService` handles URL and search input.
- `FaviconService` fetches and caches page icons.

Important paths:

```text

  App/
  Models/
  Views/
  Services/
  Web/
  Resources/
Scripts/
Benchmarks/
```

Contributions are welcome, especially around native Mac behavior,
keyboard-first browsing, WebKit lifecycle, and battery efficiency.

Please keep changes aligned with the project principles above. In particular,
do not introduce another browser engine, do not add idle polling, and do not
copy Arc or Zen branding, icons, assets, or exact UI.

## Releases

Release builds are packaged as a drag-to-Applications DMG. The GitHub workflow
on `main` publishes the signed DMG, `latest.json`, and Sparkle `appcast.xml` to
the separate marketing site repository.

Local DMG packaging:

```sh
xcodebuild -project "Candoa.xcodeproj" -scheme "Candoa" -configuration Release -derivedDataPath build/DerivedData build
Scripts/package_dmg.sh \
  build/DerivedData/Build/Products/Release/Candoa.app \
  artifacts/Candoa.dmg
```
