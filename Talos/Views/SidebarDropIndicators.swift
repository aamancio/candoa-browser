/// A highlight over the whole row said "this row is the target" and stopped
/// there — which of the two panes you were about to land in was left to the
/// person to guess. Zen answers it by putting a translucent
/// `zen-split-fake-tab` into the row on the drop side so the row becomes a
/// small picture of the result; this is that.
/// A single translucent rectangle over the half of the row the dragged tab
/// would take. That is the whole treatment — it is what Zen shows, and the
/// row underneath is left exactly as it is.
///
/// What this replaces tried to draw the *result*: the row's tab shifted into
/// the pane it would keep, an opaque cover, a matching fill on both halves.
/// It measured correctly and it was the wrong idea — a row mid-drag turning
/// into two solid blocks reads as two rows, not as one tab being offered a
/// split. A ghost is one rectangle that is not there yet.
