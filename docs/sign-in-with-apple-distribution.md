# Sign in with Apple and Developer ID Distribution

Status: accepted  
Last verified: August 8, 2026

## Decision

Talos's public website download is a Developer ID-signed, notarized DMG. It must use
Sign in with Apple for the web, initiated with `ASWebAuthenticationSession`, rather than
the native `ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider` flow.

Apple's current [supported capabilities for macOS](https://developer.apple.com/help/account/reference/supported-capabilities-macos)
list Sign in with Apple for Apple Developer Program distribution but not for Developer ID.
Consequently, the public DMG must not contain the `com.apple.developer.applesignin`
entitlement.

## Why the native development test is misleading

An Apple Development provisioning profile can include Sign in with Apple and successfully
present Apple's native authorization sheet. That proves only that the development build and
developer account are configured. It does not prove that the capability can be included in a
Developer ID-signed release distributed outside the Mac App Store.

Do not treat any of these as release verification:

- A Debug build that presents the native Apple sheet.
- A successful native sign-in while signed with `Apple Development`.
- Unit tests of the identity-token exchange endpoint.
- An unsigned or ad hoc-signed local Release build.

## Required public-DMG architecture

1. Talos requests an intent from Talos Cloud —
   `POST /api/auth/native-apple/sign-in-intent` for a fresh sign-in, or
   `POST /api/auth/native-apple/link-intent` (with the current session token) to link Apple
   to an existing anonymous account — and receives an HTTPS authorization URL on the Cloud
   origin.
2. Talos starts `ASWebAuthenticationSession` at that URL. Talos Cloud's page hands the
   flow to Better Auth (`sign-in/social` or `link-social`), which redirects to Apple using
   the configured Apple Services ID.
3. Apple returns to Better Auth's registered HTTPS callback on the Cloud origin.
4. Talos Cloud completes the flow (`/api/auth/native-apple/complete`) and hands off to the
   app via `talos://auth/apple` (Debug builds use `talos-dev://`) carrying a short-lived,
   hashed one-time code — never the session token itself.
5. Talos Browser exchanges the code through `POST /api/auth/native-apple/exchange` and
   stores only the resulting Talos session token in Keychain.

The system dialog saying that Talos wants to use the Cloud domain to sign in is expected
`ASWebAuthenticationSession` security UI. Do not attempt to suppress it, imitate it, or move
the Apple flow into an embedded `WKWebView`.

Debug builds may use `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api` for Cloud development, but Apple web
authentication must use the deployed registered HTTPS origin. A production-issued session
cannot be validated against a local database or a different signing secret.
`TALOS_CLOUD_API_URL` selects the single Cloud authority. A separately registered HTTPS
development authority may be supplied explicitly; localhost and loopback callbacks are not
valid production substitutes.

## Changes that are prohibited for the current DMG

- Adding `com.apple.developer.applesignin` to `Talos.entitlements`.
- Enabling the Xcode Sign in with Apple capability for the public target.
- Replacing the public flow with `ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider` because it worked locally.
- Pointing Apple web authorization at `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`.
- Calling authentication complete before the deployed callback and a signed public DMG have
  both been tested.

## Release verification

Before shipping or closing an authentication issue:

1. Confirm the deployed sign-in-intent route returns an authorization URL that reaches
   `appleid.apple.com`.
2. Complete a real Apple authorization, HTTPS callback, `talos://auth/apple` handoff, and
   one-time-code exchange.
3. Confirm account restoration works after relaunch and cancellation returns without an error.
4. Inspect the actual public app with `codesign` and confirm the signing identity is
   `Developer ID Application`.
5. Inspect the same artifact's entitlements and confirm
   `com.apple.developer.applesignin` is absent. CI enforces this: the Static Quality Gate
   fails on any entitlements file containing a forbidden entitlement, and the release
   workflow's "Verify entitlement policy" step fails the build if the signed app carries
   one.
6. Notarize, staple, and test the packaged DMG on a clean macOS account.

## When this decision may change

The native flow may replace the web flow only if either:

- Talos explicitly changes to a compatible distribution channel such as the Mac App Store; or
- Apple's current capability documentation and an actual Developer ID-signed release prove
  that native Sign in with Apple has become supported.

Re-check Apple's capability matrix at that time and update this document in the same change.
